Just ordered the next batch of Corny boards, and these will be built from r3 blueprints. They should arrive to me by the end of the week. Meanwhile, here's a nice render of r3:

As you can see, I removed support for on-board controllers and routed the matrix out on both sides of the PCB. This should make it much easier to assemble Cornys using Pro Micro (or elite-c, or any QMK-compatible microcontroller board). As a bonus, the board now resembles a stick of corn, doesn't it? :)
