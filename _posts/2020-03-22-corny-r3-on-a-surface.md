Hey, stanger!

Haven't written lots of updates this year, have I? 

Well, have you seen what is going on in the world?!

Nevertheless, I've got something very exciting for you -- the first public pictures of my Corny keyboard!!!
Here they are:

I am still considering some additional changes before starting shipping kits and pre-builts so, stay tuned!!!
