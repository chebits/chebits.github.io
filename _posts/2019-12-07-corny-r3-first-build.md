title: Corny r3 update
---

Hello again!

Today I finaly received pcbs for Corny r3 and they look amazing! I also got those rubber pushbuttons I mentioned in the last update and was quite happyto find out that, despite the new buttons being 2 mm bigger than the pcbs were designed for, they still fit into Cornys.

It is also worth to mention that new buttons are much, much softer and more pleasant to type with. They also look badass (pictures tomorrow). Unfortunately, this did not result in improved typing accuracy or speed (although both improve as I write ths post so, I probably wll just write another post dedicated specifically to these topics), which is a big dissapointment.

The wiring became simpler, but much more condensed and now requires a lot of soldering. It took me more than four hours to buld the keyboard because of all the soldering.

Overall, despite still looking very geeky, the third revision feels much more production-ready than previous versions and I may even start a GB with them. More details to come...
